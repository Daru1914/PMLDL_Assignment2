This repository contains the Graph Neural Network solution to Movie Recommendation System. In this approach, each movie and user can be represented as nodes in a graph, and the interactions or relationships between them can be modeled as edges. Movie-user interactions, such as ratings, can be incorporated into the graph structure as edge values. A GNN could then be employed to learn node embeddings, capturing both the features of movies and users and their complex relationships. This enables the model to make personalized recommendations by leveraging the graph structure and learning latent representations that encode user preferences and movie characteristics. Additionally, GNNs inherently handle collaborative filtering by considering the connections between users who have similar preferences. This approach allows for a more dynamic and context-aware recommendation system that can adapt to the evolving interactions within the movie-user graph.
